# Modules

Join is organized into five specialized modules, each addressing specific needs in building high-performance networked applications.

This modular organization provides:

* clear separation of concerns
* easy navigation through the codebase
* logical grouping of related functionality

---

## 🏗️ Core Module

**Foundation components and runtime primitives**

The core module provides essential building blocks including the epoll-based reactor, socket abstractions (TCP, UDP, TLS, Unix), threading primitives, lock-free queues, a lock-free arena allocator, timers, and utilities.

**Key Components:**
- Reactor pattern with epoll
- TCP/UDP/TLS sockets
- Thread pools and synchronization
- Lock-free shared memory queues
- Lock-free arena allocator (slab pools)
- High-precision timers

👉 See: [Core Module]({{< ref "core" >}})

## 🌐 Fabric Module

**Network control and Linux fabric management**

The fabric module provides network interface management, ARP protocol implementation, and DNS resolution for controlling and monitoring the Linux network stack.

**Key Components:**
- Netlink-based interface manager
- ARP client implementation
- DNS resolver

👉 See: [Fabric Module]({{< ref "fabric" >}})

---

## 🔐 Crypto Module

**Security and cryptographic operations**

The crypto module offers cryptographic functions built on OpenSSL, including hashing, HMAC, digital signatures, and encoding utilities.

**Key Components:**
- Hash functions (MD5, SHA-1/224/256/384/512)
- HMAC with stream support
- Digital signatures (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, EdDSA)
- Base64 encoding/decoding

👉 See: [Crypto Module]({{< ref "crypto" >}})

---

## 📊 Data Module

**High-performance serialization**

The data module provides fast JSON and MessagePack parsers with both DOM and SAX-style interfaces, plus compression support.

**Key Components:**
- High-performance JSON parser (DOM/SAX)
- MessagePack binary format
- Zlib compression streams
- Dynamic value containers

👉 See: [Data Module]({{< ref "data" >}})

---

## 🚀 Services Module

**Application protocols**

The services module implements common application-layer protocols including HTTP/HTTPS client and server, SMTP/SMTPS client, and chunked transfer encoding.

**Key Components:**
- HTTP/1.1 client and server
- SMTP/SMTPS email client
- Chunked transfer encoding
- Mail message construction

👉 See: [Services Module]({{< ref "services" >}})

---

## Internal Structure

The framework code is internally organized with dependencies between modules:

```text
 ├─ Core (foundation)
 ├─ Crypto
 ├─ Fabric
 ├─ Data
 └─ Services
```
